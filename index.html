            <h2>My Thoughts on Anil Seth's 2017 Ted Talk Titled “Your Brain Hallucinates Your Conscious Reality”</h2>
            <p>
Anil Seth is a cognitive neuroscientist... 
            </p>
<p>
(a) Anil Seth’s TED conference delves into the topic of consciousness and self. He explores the “inner universe” of consciousness in terms of biology and physics, but in a more easy and digestible way for the average person. From his understanding of consciousness, he hopes to bridge neuroscience, computer science, mathematics, artificial intelligence, psychiatry, philosophy, and psychology. 
</p>
            <p>
In my opinion Anil Seth does a wonderful job in conveying the main ideas of his talk about consciousness. It all starts with an alluring and eye-catching title “your brain hallucinates your conscious reality”. Despite its simplicity, it clearly conveys that the Ted talk will have something to do with the brain, hallucinations and perception of reality and consciousness. 
            </p>
The talk starts off with a short story that started as follows; “just over a year ago, for a third time in my life, I ceased to exist”. Anil Seth goes on to explain that during that time he had undergone a small operation and that they administered him anesthesia. He proceeds to clarify his statement of ceasing to exist due to the anesthetic making him feel a ‘sense of detachment and falling apart’, as though nothing mattered anymore and lacked what makes reality ‘real’. He explains that moment to have a sense of ‘coldness’, possibly trying to convey his comfort, or lack thereof, at that moment. After this statement, Anil Seth comes back and says “and then I was back, drowsy and disoriented, but definitely there”. The speaker here is trying to tell the audience that despite the anesthetics he was ‘still there’, well sort of. I really like the way he told this story, and despite me never experiencing anesthesia I too was imagining myself in his position. Anil Seth then smoothly transitions to deep sleep, and how one might feel about time and oversleeping, and the basic sense of time having passed, comparing sleep to his experience under anesthesia. He goes on to say that there was no true way for him to subconsciously know how long he was out for, and compares anesthesia to ‘modern magic’. The use of words here ‘modern magic’ is brilliant in my opinion, giving the story a more fantasy and story-telling feel, all while anchoring it down to reality with a very real experience that could happen to anyone. Anil Seth goes on to mention more attractive words such as ‘hope’, and ‘one of the greatest mysteries’ once again retaining the attention of the audience with such language. If I do have to critique Anil Seth in any way, I would critique the comparison to sleep, I feel like it was not necessary at the moment.
<p>

After this brief introduction, which I felt was overall well thought-out and executed, Anil Seth starts explaining the science of consciousness. I thought this was brilliant as he has just captured the attention of the audience with a great story and exciting words and phrases. He goes on to give numerous examples that were all very interesting, with some being interactive (listening to an ambiguous recording with no real words being spoken only for our brain to hallucinate hearing a sentence after we are told something that sounds sort of similar to the recording). Overall, I believe Anil Seth did a wonderful job of presenting interesting stories and examples while wedging in some actual facts about consciousness. 
</p>

(b) Despite all the positives that I have said above, I do believe there is room for improvement for Anil Seth. Had I been in his place I would have tried to shorten the duration of the talk from 16 minutes, to around 10 minutes or shorter. I say this as people nowadays have relatively short attention span, and anything longer than 10 minutes, no matter how interesting, does tend to reduce audience retention. If I imagine myself doing the talk, I would try to be slightly more energetic and passionate while speaking, not to say that Anil Seth was not passionate, his facial features however seemed to lack excitement and enthusiasm at times. It seems to me that Anil Seth is somewhat of a professional at giving talks, as demonstrated by his perfect body language throughout the talk, and I do hope one day I might measure up to him. Body language plays into stage presence, and I believe that Anil Seth had a great presence about him that would have been even better had he displayed more emotions.
</p>
            <p>
Moving on to the content of the talk, I love the fact that Anil Seth would give you a story or an example, and would then proceed to give you some scientific facts after capturing your attention, so I would also try to do the same. I would try to improve upon the slides as Anil Seth’s slides seemed to be rather dull and dark. Animating the slides would be ideal, but not too much so as to not distract the audience. And finally, in my opinion, the biggest improvement to the talk given by Anil Seth is giving the people something to ponder, an afterthought, something that will keep churning in their heads after the talk and incite conversation and discussion among the audience.
